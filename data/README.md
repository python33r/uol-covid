# Datasets

`2020-cases.csv` and `2021-cases.csv` contain the accumulated daily case
reports for staff, students and other individuals (e.g., contractors) at the
University of Leeds, in 2020 and 2021 respectively.

These datasets include corrections made to the previous week's case numbers
due to late reporting of test results.  They do *not* include test results
that have been reported more than a week late, since the University of Leeds
does not make these later corrections public in the daily case data.

`2020-active.csv` and `2021-active.csv` contain the day-by-day active case
totals, computed by summing the daily totals within a ten-day sliding window.
